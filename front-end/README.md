# Words Game Front-End

## Description

Words Game is an interactive activity that helps students practice categorizing words according to their part of speech. The front-end of the game is a React.js project bundled by Vite.js that includes several screens: a Landing Page, a Practice Screen, a Rank Screen, and a Leader Board screen.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the `front-end` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
4. Alternatively, you can run `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview` to preview the built version.

## Usage

To use the game, open the React app in your browser. The Landing Page will be displayed, allowing you to enter your name and register for the game. Once registered, you can see your personal best score, previous attempt score, and rank.

To play the game, navigate to the Practice Screen by clicking on the “Play” button. This screen will show one word at a time with four buttons representing four options for the part of speech: noun, adverb, adjective, or verb. Select an option to receive feedback on whether your answer was correct or incorrect.

After answering all of the questions, the Rank Screen will be displayed. This screen shows your rank across your peers and includes a “Try Again” button that allows you to repeat the activity.

You can view the Leader Board screen to see how you rank against other players.
You can view the home screen for personal best and previous attempt score.
